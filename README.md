# Reconstruction of ECG Signals
A project based on the 2010 PhysioNet Challenge: "Mind the Gap." This project focuses on the reconstruction of a missing part of an ECG signal through adaptive filtering. Two adaptive filtering methods were used: RLS and ADAM. Hyperparameter studies were conducted to determine the best filter parameters for the two methods.
